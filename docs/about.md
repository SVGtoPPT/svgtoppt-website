# About

A [scalable vector graphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics){:target="_blank"} (SVG) is an image format that enables infinite scaling without pixelation, unlike [raster graphic formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics){:target="_blank"} like JPEG and PNG. Apple Keynote and Microsoft PowerPoint don't support SVG files natively, though they have "shapes" that are vectors.

[PPT](https://www.lifewire.com/ppt-file-2622187){target=_blank} (Microsoft PowerPoint 97-2003) is an old file format developed primarily for Microsoft's PowerPoint software. Due to its popularity, it can be opened in many programs, free and paid alike.

!!! history info

    === "2005"

        David Astling publishes a [script](http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/zusman/dave/svg2key/){target=_blank} that converts SVG files to Keynote shapes. It no longer runs on newer versions of macOS (likely due to being 32-bit).

    === "2016"

        Kyle Ledbetter posts [an article](https://kyleledbetter.medium.com/how-to-import-an-svg-into-powerpoint-or-keynote-8d3d70f347a7){target=_blank} outlining how to import SVG files into Keynote or Powerpoint by using a PPT file as an intermediary. [Others](https://medium.com/@chrishoman_15983/i-often-encounter-problems-with-opening-files-created-with-openoffice-and-i-found-libreoffice-a-5a72f652160f){target=_blank} noted Libre Office is more stable with less quirks.

    === "2021"
        I found myself needing to transfer lots of SVG files into Keynote. To make it easier I made a crude [Alfred workflow](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) to automate it. Then I was able to generalize it into a [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/){target=_blank} script with a dynamic [Libre Office macro](https://help.libreoffice.org/latest/en-US/text/shared/01/06130000.html){target=_blank}.

    === "2023"
        Apple releases Keynote 13.1 which includes native support for SVG files.

If you would like native support for SVG files and other vector formats, I recommend voting on [Microsoft PowerPoint suggestions](https://powerpoint.uservoice.com/){target=_blank}.

## Known Issues

| Issue | Resolution |
|--|--|
| Fonts don't transfer well when doing conversions from SVG to PPT to Keynote (automated or not) | Convert text to curves/outlines/paths when exporting your SVG |
| Gradients displays fine in Libre Office but when opening the PPT file in Keynote it's gone | Recreate the gradient with Keynote's [native gradient fill](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210063){target=_blank} or save your content as a PDF file and drag & drop into Keynote to retain your original gradient |
| Background rectangle displays fine in Libre Office but when opening the PPT file in Keynote the rectangle is small | Resize rectangle or use Keynote's [native background color](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211077){target=_blank} on your slides |  |  |
